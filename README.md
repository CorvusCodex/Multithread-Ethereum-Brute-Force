# Multithread Ethereum Bruteforce
Ethereum Bruteforce Node.js script that uses the cluster module to create multiple worker processes to generate random Ethereum keypairs and check if the public address corresponding to the private key is in a Set of full addresses from data.txt. If a match is found, private key and address will be saved inside match.txt

## Installation

1. Install Node.js on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run npm install to install the required dependencies.

## For people without technical experience you can buy the compiled application for windows from here:

Keep in mind that a Windows app wonâ€™t speed up searching or guarantee success.

## Usage

1. Edit file data.txt in the same directory as the script and add the Ethereum addresses you want to search for, one per line start with 0x. (Like 3 exmples included). Make sure there is nothing(new line,spaces, etc...) after last address.
2. Run node app.js to start the script.
3. Chose display version, default is 1
4. The script will display the loop count and keys generated per minute for each worker process.
5. The Script look for a FULL address from data.txt
6. If a match is found, the script will save the wallet and its private key (seed) to a file named match.txt and exit.

## Dependencies
This script uses the following dependencies:

1. cluster: Node.js module to create multiple worker processes
2. fs: Node.js module to read and write files
3. os: Node.js module to get system information
4. blessed: A library for creating terminal-based user interfaces
5. ethers: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
